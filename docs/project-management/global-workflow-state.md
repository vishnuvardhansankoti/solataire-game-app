## Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub Pages subdirectory base-path breaks asset URLs | Medium | High | Set `paths.base` in `svelte.config.js`; tested in CI |
| Service Worker caches stale build | Medium | Medium | Workbox cache-busting via hashed filenames |
| localStorage quota exceeded for large game states | Low | Low | Dexie.js adapter abstraction in Phase 3 |
| Drag-and-drop behavior inconsistent across browsers | Medium | Medium | Playwright cross-browser E2E tests in Phase 4 |
